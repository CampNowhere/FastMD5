## Fast x64 MD5
MD5 library for x64 written in assembler

Requirements to compile:

make 
gcc
nasm

All of the above should be available to install in your distribution of choice's package manager. If you use Windows, you might be able to use [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org) with varying degrees of success.

This library is a proof-of-concept at this point. All that is supported right now is the hashing of strings < 56 characters in length. The test program generated by make process takes a string as an argument and prints out the hash. 

This library has been designed with thread safety in mind, with the end goal of implemented in a multi-threaded program to generate hashes as fast as possible. To link this library into your own programs, the following simple commands can be used:

```
nasm -felf64 -o fastmd5.o
gcc your_program.c fastmd5.o -o your_program
```

Read fastmd5.h for function definitions. The caller must prepare and zero-pad their own input buffer.

#Todo:

1. Improve wrapper code to make the library as simple to call as possible
2. Allow arbitrary length messages to be hashed
3. Improve assembler padding code.
